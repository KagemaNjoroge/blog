Starting [TomorrowAI](https://tomorrow.co.ke) has been an incredible journey, marked by overcoming some of my biggest fears. I faced a barrage of doubts: Will anyone buy my product? What if I fail? What will people think of me? The assumptions people made about my financial status because I had a startup only added to the pressure.

Despite these fears, I plunged into the entrepreneurial world, and here's what I've learned along the way.

### The Power of Launching Early

In the early stages, I had a grand vision for what TomorrowAI could become. I listed out every feature I wanted our product to have, but I quickly realized that trying to implement everything at once was a recipe for delay. Instead, I focused on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We launched quickly, even though the product wasn't perfect. This allowed us to get real-world feedback, fix bugs, and add features that truly mattered to our users. Helping customers resolve issues promptly helped build trust and foster long-term relationships.

### The Importance of Effective Marketing

A great product is meaningless if no one knows about it. With a limited budget, we couldn't afford expensive ad campaigns, so we took a more personal approach. We reached out directly to potential customers via email and phone. This direct communication was not only cost-effective but also helped us understand our customers' needs better. Word-of-mouth became our best marketing tool, as satisfied customers told others about our product.

### Value Over Price

In a competitive market, it might seem logical to lower prices to attract customers. However, we took a different approach. We positioned TomorrowAI as a premium product, focusing on the unique value we offered. Just like iPhones are priced higher than Android phones but are valued for their quality and exclusivity, we charged more than our competitors and justified it with superior features and service.

### Finding Our Niche

We observed that the point-of-sale (POS) software market was saturated. To stand out, we specialized in integrating POS software with Kenya's eTIMS tax system. Additionally, most POS solutions in the market lacked iOS apps, so we developed one to cater to more affluent clients. This focus on a specific niche helped us attract a dedicated customer base.

### Innovation and Simplicity

Our goal was to create a product that was not only innovative but also easy to use. One standout feature we developed was a one-tap solution for business owners to file their taxes. This kind of simplicity resonated well with our users, making our product indispensable.

### Building the Right Team

Starting TomorrowAI was more about building a dream than making an immediate profit. Finding co-founders who shared this vision was crucial. We worked on the project as a side hustle, without drawing salaries, driven by our passion and commitment. This shared dedication has been fundamental to our progress.

### Focus on Functionality

In the tech world, there's a constant urge to chase the latest frameworks and programming languages. However, we learned that our customers don't care about the technology behind the product as long as it works seamlessly. Instead of getting caught up in learning new tools, we focused on building with what we knew and improving it over time.

### Reflecting on the Journey

The journey of starting TomorrowAI has been fraught with challenges, but each hurdle has been a learning opportunity. From launching an MVP to direct marketing, charging for value, finding a niche, innovating, and building the right team, every step has taught me something valuable.

We are still a small startup, but we've made significant progress. Our customer base is growing, and we're constantly improving our product based on user feedback. The fears that once held me back have been replaced by a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the future.

If you're considering starting your own venture, remember that overcoming fear is part of the process. Embrace the journey, learn from every experience, and keep pushing forward. The path to success is rarely straight, but with persistence and passion, it's achievable.
