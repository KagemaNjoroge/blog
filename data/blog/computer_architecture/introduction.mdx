}}>Difference between Computer Architecture and Computer Architecture</u>

**Computer Architecture** - refers to those attributes that are visible to the user like addressing techniques, instruction sets, and bits used for data and have direct impact on the logical execution of a program. A  term used interchangeably with Computer Architecture is *Instruction Set Architecture* . 

**Computer Organization** - refers to the operational units of a computer and their interconnections that realize the architectural specifications.

}}>Computer Structure and Computer Function</u>

**Computer Structure** - the way in which components in a computer system are interrelated.

**Computer Function** - the operation of each individual component in the structure.

}}>Basic Functions that a computer can perform </u>

- **Data Processing**  - a computer manipulates data by perfoming operations on the numbers.
- **Data Storage**- the computer temporarily stores pieces of data that are being worked on. Files are stored on the computer for subsquent retrieval and update.
- **Data Movement** - a computers operating environment consists of devices that act as sources or destinations of data. When data are delivered or received from a device that is directly connected to the computer, the process is known as *Input-Output(I/O)* and that device is referred to as the *peripheral device*. When data is to be transmitted over distances, the process is known as *Data Communications*.
- **Control** - managing of computer resources.
