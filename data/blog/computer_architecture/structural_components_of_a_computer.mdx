}}>Four main stuructural components</u>
- **Central Processing Unit** - controls the operations of the computer. Performs data processing operations.
- **Main Memory** - stores data
- **I/O** - provides a mean of communication between the computer and its external environment.
- **System Interconnection** - buses - comprises of lines of wires that provide interconnection between various computer components.

1. <u style={{color : '#EC4899'}}>Central processing unit (CPU)</u>  

Its major structural components are:
- **Arithmetic and Logic Unit** - performs computer data processing operations
- **Control Unit** - controls the operations. of the cpu and hence the computer.
- **Registers** - provides storage internal to the CPU.
- **CPU Interconnection** - provides a mechanism of communication between the ALU, control unit and registers.


<u style={{color : '#EC4899'}}>Multicore computer structure</u>  

Most modern computers consist of multiple processors. When these processors are reside on a single chip, the term **Multicore computer** is used.

<u style={{color : '#EC4899'}}>*Necessary definitions*</u>

- **Central Processing Unit** - fetches and executes instructions.
- **Core** - an individual processing unit on a processing chip.
- **Processsor** - a physical piece of silicon that consists of one or more cores.
