Welcome to the Mojo Cheat Sheet - your ultimate quick reference guide to mastering the Mojo programming language. If you've been intrigued by Mojo's promise of combining the best of Python's ease of use with the performance of C++ and Rust, you're in the right place.
This quick reference guide will equip you with the essential knowledge and insights to start coding with Mojo like a pro.

## Mojo REPL

Mojo comes with a built-in REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) that you can use to quickly test out your code. To start the REPL, simply type `mojo` in your terminal. You should see something like this:

```bash
$ mojo
```

## Hello World

Let's start with the obligatory Hello World program. Here's how you do it in Mojo _(type this in the REPL)_:

```python
  print("Hello World!")
```

Mojo's syntax is very similar to Python's, so if you're familiar with Python, you'll feel right at home.

## Building and Running a Mojo Files

Mojo source files are identified with either the .mojo or .ðŸ”¥ file extension.  
**Running .mojo files**  
Create a file called `hello_world.mojo` and type the following code in it:

```python
  fn main():
    print("Hello World!")
```

Head back to the terminal and run the file with the following command:

```bash
$ mojo hello_world.mojo
```

**Building .mojo files**  
Mojo files are compiled to native binaries. To build a Mojo file, use the `build` command:

```bash
$ mojo build hello_world.mojo
```

The command above creates the binary with the same name as the .mojo file, but you can change that with the `-o` option.  
**Running the built binary**

```bash
$ ./hello_world
```

The executable is a statically-compiled binary, which means it has no external library dependencies and it can run on any system with the same CPU architecture as your own.

## Language Basics

Like all compiled languages, Mojo programs require a `main()` function as the entry point. The `main` function is where the program starts executing.

```python
  fn main():
    print("Hello World!")
```

## Syntax and Semantics

Mojo supports all Python's syntax and semantics.  
 Mojo uses line breaks to separate statements, so you don't need to use semicolons to terminate statements.

```python
  fn main():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("Hello World!")
```

Code blocks are delimited by indentation, so you don't need to use curly braces to delimit blocks. It's just like Python.

```python
  fn main():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("Hello World!")
```

## Variables

Variables in Mojo are declared using `let` and `var` keywords.  
âˆš `let` is used to declare variables that can't be reassigned.  
âˆš `var` is used to declare variables that can be reassigned.

```python
  let x = 10 # x can't be reassigned
  var y = 20 # y can be reassigned
```

**Type Annotations**  
Declaring variable types is optional in Mojo, but you can add type annotations if you want to.

```python
  let x: Int = 10 # x is an integer
```

If you don't specify a type, Mojo will infer it for you. For example,

```python
    let x = 10 # x is an integer, type is automatically inferred
    ley y:Int = 20 # y is an integer

    print(x + y) # 30
```

## Functions

Functions in Mojo are declared using the `fn` keyword.

```python
  fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:
    return x + y
```

**Calling Functions**

```python
  fn main():
    let x = 10
    let y = 20
    let z = add(x, y)
    print(z) # 30
```

Mojo functions can also be declared with the `def` keyword (just like Python).

```python
  def add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:
    return x + y
```

## Structures

A struct in Mojo is **similar to a Python class**: they both support methods, fields, operator overloading, decorators for metaprogramming

```python
struct Car:
  var mileage : Int
  var tyres : Int

  fn __init__(inout self, mileage : Int, tyres : Int):
    self.mileage = mileage
    self.tyres = tyres

```

Differences between Mojo's Struct and Python's Class

| Mojo Struct                                                | Python Class                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mojo structs are dynamic - They are bound at compile time. | Python classes are dynamic - they allow for dynamically binding instance properties at runtime. |

## Integration with Python

Mojo is interoperable with Python  
Itâ€™s easy to use Python modules you know and love in Mojo. You can import any Python module into your Mojo program and create Python types from Mojo types.

```python
from python import Python
# let's import numpy from python
let np = Python.import_module("numpy") # similar to import numpy as np
let array = np.array([1, 2])

```

**Conclusion**

Mojo, with its incredible blend of performance and ease of use, is poised to redefine the landscape of AI development. As you've seen in this cheat sheet, Mojo's Python-like syntax makes it approachable, even for those new to systems programming.
