My dad was an absentee dad. Despite his absence, I don't hold any ill will against him, even in his resting place. However, this meant my mum didn't have enough money to send me to school. My sharp mind is my only super power. I excelled in primary school, but I couldn't secure a scholarship through Wings to Fly. Then, a noble man named Tr. Charles Waweru told my story to KTDA Gacharage, and I received a full scholarship for high school. I performed exceptionally well in my final exams, becoming the top student nationwide among those sponsored by KTDA.

This achievement opened doors for me. I was admitted to the University of Nairobi, and my sponsor paid for my first year. However, in my second year, my mum was supposed to take over the financial burden. I realized that continuing my education at that point would be selfish, as it would drain resources needed for my siblings' future. I dropped out, took on various day jobs in the city, and faced heartbreak and disappointment. I vowed never to be employed again, to make people come to me, not to chase or beg, but to be true to myself and strive for self-improvement.

> Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mine worker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another. - Nelson Mandela

Despite the challenges, I cannot give up. I believe that if God is just, He will not let me leave this world without helping children in dusty African villages like mine to get a decent education. I want to give them a fair shot at life. This is my greatest motivation for not giving up.

I have come a long way, and I know that my journey is far from over. My dream is to establish a foundation to support the education of underprivileged kids. There are so many children who, like me, have the potential to achieve great things but lack the resources to do so. Their dreams should not be extinguished because of financial constraints. I carry the dreams of these small kids with me, and I cannot let them down.

>African children are mental powehouses. They just need a chance to prove it. - Kagema Njoroge

For anyone who reads this, know that you are not alone in your struggles. Life can be incredibly tough, but it's in these moments of vulnerability that we find our true strength. Keep pushing forward, seek support, and never give up on your dreams. Together, we can change the fate of poor kids and give them the opportunity to mark their place in this world.
