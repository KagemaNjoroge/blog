summary: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a captivating field that has made significant advancements in recent years. However, in the grand scheme of things, we've only scratched the surface of its potential. This blog explores the reasons behind AI's ongoing infancy, including challenges related to understanding human intelligence, data bias, ethics, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. While AI holds immense promise, addressing these challenges and focusing on ethical development and sustainability will be key to unlocking its true potential. The journey ahead is exciting, and the world of AI is poised for transformation as we delve deeper into its possibilities.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword for quite some time now, capturing the imaginations of scientists, technologists, and the general public alike. While AI has made remarkable strides in recent years, it's important to recognize that we are far from achieving the full potential of this transformative technology. In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of AI and explore why we're not there yet, but rather, we've only just scratched the surface of what AI can achieve. I know that ChatGPT is mind-blowing, but I can confidently state that AI today is just a drop in the ocean.

**The Current State of AI**

Before we dive into the reasons why we're still in the infancy of AI, let's take a moment to appreciate how far we've come. AI has made impressive strides in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and even healthcare. We now have AI-powered virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars like Tesla, recommendation systems, and advanced medical diagnostic tools. These are all significant accomplishments, but they are just the tip of the iceberg.

Even with the tech "giants" like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft investing heavily in AI research, we are still far from achieving the full potential of AI. While AI has made significant progress in recent years, it's important to recognize that we are still in the infancy of AI. We've only just scratched the surface of what AI can achieve, and there is still a long way to go before we reach the full potential of this transformative technology.

And just to pose the question, is Apple fighting along the other giants in this AI race? Apple made a big impact by introducing the iPhone but we haven't seen them in this battle to rule the world of AI. Is Apple just sitting back and watching the other giants fight it out? Or are they working on something big that will blow us away? Only time will tell.  
**Why We're Not There Yet**

1. **Limited Understanding of Human Intelligence**: One of the fundamental challenges of AI is that we are still unraveling the mysteries of human intelligence. While we've made great progress in mimicking certain aspects of human cognition, we are far from replicating the full spectrum of human intelligence, including common sense reasoning, emotional intelligence, and creativity.

2. **Data and Bias**: AI systems heavily rely on data to learn and make decisions. However, the data we feed into these systems often carries inherent biases. This can lead to AI systems making unfair or biased decisions, as they simply learn from historical data. Addressing bias in AI is a complex and ongoing challenge.

3. **Ethical Dilemmas**: As AI becomes more capable, ethical concerns become increasingly relevant. Questions about privacy, surveillance, job displacement, and the moral responsibility of AI systems are far from being fully resolved.

4. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: AI is a multi-faceted field that requires collaboration among experts from various domains, including computer science, neuroscience, psychology, ethics, and more. Building comprehensive AI systems requires breaking down silos and fostering interdisciplinary cooperation.

5. **Energy Consumption**: Training advanced AI models often requires massive amounts of computational power, which in turn consumes a significant amount of energy. Finding sustainable solutions for AI development is imperative in a world concerned about climate change. Deep Learning models are very power hungry. According to the [Mosharaf Chowdhury, of the University of Michigan](https://news.umich.edu/optimization-could-cut-the-carbon-footprint-of-ai-training-by-up-to-75/), training the GPT-3 model just once consumes 1,287 MWh, which is enough to supply an average U.S. household for 120 years

6. **Safety and Robustness**: Ensuring the safety and robustness of AI systems is a critical challenge. AI systems can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and ensuring they make reliable decisions in real-world scenarios is an ongoing area of research.

**The Road Ahead**

Despite these challenges, the future of AI is bright. Researchers and experts around the world are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. To truly unlock AI's potential, we must focus on the following:

1. **Ethical AI Development**: Implementing strict ethical guidelines and practices to minimize bias, ensure transparency, and prioritize safety.

2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Encouraging collaboration across fields to create holistic AI systems that better mimic human intelligence.

3. **Education and Awareness**: Promoting AI literacy and awareness among the general public to foster informed discussions and decisions.

4. **Sustainability**: Investing in research to reduce the energy consumption of AI models and make AI development more environmentally friendly.

5. **Responsible AI Governance**: Developing comprehensive regulations and standards for AI to ensure it benefits society as a whole.
6. **Funding Open-Source AI Research**: Supporting open-source AI research to democratize AI and make it accessible to everyone. What happens if tools like Pytorch, Tensorflow, just to name a few, lack community support? We need to support these tools and the people behind them.

I do strongly suggest that you read the [OpenAI Charter](https://openai.com/charter/). It's a great read and it will give you a better understanding of the future of AI.
Am also for the idea that AI is not a battle of dominance but a race for ideas, and the more we share these ideas, the better the future of AI will be.

In conclusion, while AI has made impressive strides, we are still at the beginning of our journey into the vast realm of artificial intelligence. The challenges ahead are substantial, but with dedication, collaboration, and ethical considerations, we can continue to unlock AI's potential and shape a future where AI truly enhances our lives in remarkable ways. We've just scratched the surface of what AI can offer, and the best is yet to come.
