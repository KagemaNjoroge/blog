The AI boom is far from over. We all know Sam Altman, the man behind OpenAI, and indeed, ChatGPT. ChatGPT took the world by storm and changed our perception about AI. Altman is now in conversations with investors to raise up to 7,000,000,000,000 (yes, that mind blowing figure) dollars in funding aimed at bolstering global production of chips specifically designed for AI technology.

Imagine a world where AI infrastructure is not just a necessity but a cornerstone of economic competitiveness. That's the vision driving Altman as he seeks to secure backing from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to fuel this chip endeavor. His goal? Nothing short of building a colossal AI infrastructure – from fab capacity to energy and data centers – on a scale never seen before. Altman seeks to achieve full AGI.

Altman's vision is clear: "The world needs more AI infrastructure than people are currently planning to build. Building massive-scale AI infrastructure, and a resilient supply chain, is crucial to economic competitiveness."

At the forefront of this AI revolution is Nvidia, the undisputed titan of the AI chip market. AI models heavily rely on their GPU's to achieve such massive scale. NVIDIA's recent dominance in the AI chip market, with an 80% share, has been immensely profitable. Could Altman be having the fear that dominance can hinder innovation?

It's a daring move, considering that $7 trillion would single-handedly create a company larger than Apple and Microsoft combined, surpassing even Alphabet's size. Should Altman succeed in raising this monumental sum, it would mark the most significant tech takeover in history

**Why Does This Matter?**  
Here are some of the reasons I hand in support for Altman.

- **Innovation and Diversity**: - [Nvidia's dominance](https://njoroge.tomorrow.co.ke/blog/ai/battle_for_ai_compute) in the AI chip market, while impressive, has the potential to stifle innovation and limit diversity in the industry. A $7 trillion investment in AI infrastructure presents an opportunity to foster a more competitive and diverse ecosystem. By empowering new players and encouraging collaboration, we can unlock new ideas, approaches, and breakthroughs that benefit society as a whole.

- **Societal Impact**: - From healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment, AI has the potential to revolutionize every aspect of our lives. By investing in AI infrastructure, we can accelerate the development and deployment of AI-powered solutions that address some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity, from climate change to healthcare access.
- **Job creation** - If you are tech savvy, it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the AI space. This venture can mean a job to you.

The significance of this $7 trillion AI venture cannot be overstated. It's about more than just chips and infrastructure – it's about shaping the future of technology, economics, and society. By investing in AI on such a massive scale, we have the opportunity to unleash the full potential of this transformative technology and create a better, more prosperous future for all.

**Some questions for you**

- Can the Altman secure $7 trillion and navigate the potential hurdles?
- How would competitors like Nvidia respond to this massive new player?
- Will this lead to more accessible and democratized AI for everyone, or further concentrate power?
