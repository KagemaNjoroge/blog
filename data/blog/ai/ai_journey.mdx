**The Voyage Begins**

For some time, the University of Nairobi was a place I called "home", a place where I could pursue my dreams of becoming an AI expert. However, my dreams were cut short when I was unable to pay my fees. I was forced to leave the university, but I did not leave my dreams behind. Instead, I am setting sail on a year-long voyage into the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a journey born from unwavering curiosity, an unbreakable belief in the transformative power of technology, and a steely resolve to overcome obstacles that life may throw my way.

**Navigating Challenges**

One might wonder how it's possible to set sail into the intricate realm of AI without the traditional academic anchor. The answer lies in the tenacity to learn, the availability of online resources, and the support of a global community of learners and enthusiasts. While I may not have a formal education from a university, I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and the resolve to turn obstacles into stepping stones. The internet is my classroom, and the global community is my teacher. I am ready to learn, to explore, and to discover. The next **Andrew Ng** might just be in the making!

**The Map Ahead: Mathematics and Computer Science**

To navigate the AI seas, I recognize the need to master the foundational disciplines of mathematics and computer science. These subjects are the compass and sextant by which I will plot my course through the uncharted territories of AI. From linear algebra to calculus, from algorithms to data structures, I am ready to embrace the mathematical and computational challenges that lie ahead.

**The Importance of Support**

As I set sail on this non-traditional route, I am ever more aware of the significance of support from the global community. My hope is that you, dear reader, will accompany me on this voyage, offering your knowledge, guidance, and encouragement. Whether you are an AI expert, a fellow learner, or simply someone who believes in the power of human curiosity, your presence on this journey is invaluable.

**How You Can Help**

1. **Share Knowledge**: If you have insights, resources, or experiences related to AI, mathematics, or computer science, please share them. Your wisdom can light my way through the fog of complexity.

2. **Connect**: Introduce me to like-minded individuals, communities, or organizations that can enrich this exploration. Collaboration is a compass that points to new horizons.

3. **Inspire**: If you have stories of your own AI odyssey or words of encouragement, share them. Inspiration is a wind that fills my sails.

4. **Stay Tuned**: Follow my updates and progress as I document this journey. Your interest keeps me accountable and motivated.

**Conclusion**

This is not just a personal voyage; it is an invitation to participate in the collective pursuit of knowledge and discovery. Together, we can chart new territories, unlock the secrets of AI, and shape the future. Let us set sail into the AI odyssey, where courage meets curiosity and where obstacles become the stepping stones to success.

Join me in this grand expedition, and let us navigate the seas of AI together.
