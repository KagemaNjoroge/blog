summary: Kenyan Gen Z's love modded WhatsApp, but they might not know the risks. This blog post explains the dangers of unofficial versions and why privacy matters.
---

Hey! If you've been on social media lately, you might've noticed friends, especially among Kenyan Gen Z, showing off fancy new WhatsApp features â€“ longer video statuses, the ability to see deleted messages, and funky new fonts. All this sounds awesome, but there's a catch... these features are only available on unofficial, modified versions of WhatsApp, like GBWhatsApp, FMWhatsApp, and others.
Before you rush to download them, let's talk about the serious risks involved.

As a software developer myself, I'm well aware of the potential dangers posed by rogue developers once they gain control over users' data and conversations.
Here is what I would do if I were to make a mod version of WhatsApp:

- I would make sure I compensate the extra features with backdoors, - I would use your phone to mine crypto on your device to earn money and slow down your device. I just can't give you extra features for free.
- Sell your data to third parties, and even worse
- I could use your device to launch attacks on other devices.
- I could also use your device to send spam messages to your contacts.
- Leak your private conversations to the public.

This is why I would never use a modded version of WhatsApp, and I would advise you to do the same.



It's a bit worrying how prevalent these mods are becoming among the Kenyan youth. Interestingly, none of my iPhone-using friends seem tempted, which makes sense since Apple has really strict rules about what apps get on their store.

**It's All About Privacy**

- **The Spy in Your Pocket** - Unofficial WhatsApp versions might not have the same end-to-end encryption that protects your conversations in the official app. From a developer's standpoint, this is a huge red flag! It means the developers of these mods could potentially access and read your messages, photos, and more.

- **Data for Sale?** - These apps aren't available on official app stores like Google Play, which means they don't go through the same security checks. There's a real chance they could secretly collect your data and sell it off to the highest bidder.

- **Malware Alert** - Modified apps are prime targets for embedding malware. This nasty software can steal your information, slow down your phone, or even worse. As a developer, I've seen the damage malware can cause.

**Don't Say You Weren't Warned**  

Let's be real here: if you choose to use a modded version of WhatsApp, you're essentially gambling with your privacy. One day, those sensitive conversations or embarrassing photos could be leaked, especially if you're one of the many Kenyan Gen Z users on these platforms, and you won't have anyone to blame but yourself. Trust me, as someone who understands code, the risks are just too high.

**The Bigger Picture**  
- **Meta's Hands are Tied** - Companies like Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) work hard to fight these unofficial versions. But it's a tricky game of cat and mouse, and the mods can be hard to completely eliminate. This seems especially true on Android phones, where it's easier to sideload modified apps.

- **Account Bans** - Using a modded WhatsApp can get your account banned permanently. You could lose years of chats and contacts with a single wrong click.

It's Not Worth the Hype.

Sure, those extra features might seem cool, but are they worth potentially exposing your entire digital life?

**Let's break down those "must-have" features**:

- **Long Video Statuses** - Can't you just break your video into shorter segments? It helps keep your friends more engaged anyway!

- **Reading Deleted Messages** - There's probably a reason someone deleted a message. Respect their choice.

- **Fancy Fonts** - Real communication is about the words, not the way they look. Also, it's not like the official app is ugly or anything. Also, you can use the bold, italic, and strikethrough features to make your messages stand out. Some smartphones even have a feature that allows you to change the font of your device. Sometimes less is more.

**A word from WhatsApp**  
Let me just share some screenshots from the official WhatsApp website. They have a whole page dedicated to the dangers of using modded versions of WhatsApp. Here are some of the things they say:

**Protect Yourself, Protect Others**

The best thing you can do is stick with the official WhatsApp app. It might not always be perfect, but it's the safest option. And please, help spread the word about the risks of modded versions, especially to your fellow Kenyan Gen Z friends!
