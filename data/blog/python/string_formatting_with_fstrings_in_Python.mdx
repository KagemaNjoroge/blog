F-strings (formatted string literals) provide a modern way to handle string formatting in Python. They were introduced in Python 3.6. They offer a more concise and readable syntax compared to the traditional `%` formatting method.

To create an f-string, begin your string literal with either lowercase `f` or uppercase `F`. This signals that it's an f-string. Inside the string, place expressions within curly braces `{}` where you want to insert their values. These expressions can include variables, calculations, function calls, or any valid Python expression.

Expressions within f-strings are evaluated at runtime, and their values are directly inserted into the string. Let's look at a basic example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
city = "New York"

message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old and lives in {city}."
print(message)
# Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old and lives in New York.
```

One notable difference from `%s` formatting is the absence of the `%` operator. Instead, variables and expressions are directly enclosed within `{}` in the string.

Additionally, f-strings support various formatting options, including:

### Numeric Precision

You can control the precision of floating-point numbers using `:.nf`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of decimal places.

```python
price = 123.456789

# Format to two decimal places
formatted_price_2 = f"Price: ${price:.2f}"
print(formatted_price_2)  # Output: Price: $123.46

# Format to three decimal places
formatted_price_3 = f"Price (3 decimals): ${price:.3f}"
print(formatted_price_3)  # Output: Price (3 decimals): $123.457

# Format to no decimal places (integer rounding)
formatted_price_int = f"Price (rounded): ${price:.0f}"
print(formatted_price_int)  # Output: Price (rounded): $123
```

### String Alignment and Width

You can align strings to the left, right, or center within a specified width using `:<w`, `:>w`, or `:^w`, where `w` is an integer.

```python
# Left alignment
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name:<10}!") # Output: Hello, Alice     !

# Right alignment
name = "Bob"
print(f"Hello, {name:>10}!") # Output: Hello,        Bob!

# Center alignment
name = "Charlie"
print(f"Hello, {name:^10}!") # Output: Hello,  Charlie !
```

### Type-Specific Formatting

You can apply type-specific formatting using `:t`, where `t` represents the type. For example, `:b` for binary, `:x` for hexadecimal, `:e` for scientific notation, `:%` for percentage, etc.

```python
# Binary format
num = 42
print(f"{num:b}") # Output: 101010

# Hexadecimal format
num = 255
print(f"{num:x}") # Output: ff

# Scientific notation format
num = 123456789
print(f"{num:e}") # Output: 1.234568e+08

# Percentage format
num = 0.75
print(f"{num:%}") # Output: 75.000000%
```

### Zero-Padding Numbers

You can pad numbers with leading zeros using `:0w`, where `w` is the width.

```python
# Padding numbers with zeros
num = 42
print(f"The answer is {num:04}.") # Output: The answer is 0042.
```

### Date and Time Formatting

For formatting date and time, f-strings support various format specifiers similar to those used with the `strftime` method. Here are some common ones:

- `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number (e.g., 2022).
- `%y`: Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 22).
- `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (01, 02, ..., 12).
- `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (01, 02, ..., 31).
- `%H`: Hour (00, 01, ..., 23).
- `%M`: Minute (00, 01, ..., 59).
- `%S`: Second (00, 01, ..., 59).
- `%A`: Weekday as a full name (Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday).
- `%a`: Weekday as an abbreviated name (Mon, Tue, ..., Sun).
- `%B`: Month as a full name (January, February, ..., December).
- `%b` or `%h`: Month as an abbreviated name (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec).
- `%p`: AM or PM.

Here's an example:

```python
import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()

print(f'The current date is {now:%Y-%m-%d}.')
print(f'The current time is {now:%H:%M:%S}.')
print(f'The current date and time is {now:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}.')
```
