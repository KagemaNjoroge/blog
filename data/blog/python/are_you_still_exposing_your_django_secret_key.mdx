Django `settings.py` contains the most sensitive information of your project. Hard coding key details such as `SECRET_KEY`,`ALLOWED_HOSTS`, database settings such `database password`, `database host`, `database port`, `database username` in your codebase is a security risk. In this article, we will discuss how to secure your Django `SECRET_KEY` by using environment variables and the python `dotenv` library. While I will focus on the `SECRET_KEY`, the same principles can be applied to other sensitive information in your Django project.

## Why is the Django `SECRET_KEY` important?

Django uses the `SECRET_KEY` to provide cryptographic signing, protection against CSRF attacks, and other security features. If an attacker gains access to your `SECRET_KEY`, they can potentially compromise the security of your Django project. It is crucial to keep the `SECRET_KEY` confidential and secure.

## Installing the `python-dotenv` library

The `python-dotenv` library allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into your Django project. To install the `python-dotenv` library, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

If you do have a `requirements.txt` file, you can add the `python-dotenv` library to it.

## Creating a `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory(the same directory as manage.py) of your Django project. Add the `SECRET_KEY` to the `.env` file in the following format:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
```

## Adding the `.env` file to `.gitignore`

The `.env` file contains sensitive information, and you should not commit it to your version control system. To prevent the `.env` file from being accidentally committed, add it to your `.gitignore` file. Here is an example of how you can add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
# .gitignore
.env
```

## Loading the `SECRET_KEY` from the `.env` file

In your `settings.py` file, you will need to import the `os` and `dotenv` modules and load the `SECRET_KEY` from the `.env` file. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

`load_dotenv()` will load the environment variables from the `.env` file into your Django project. After reading from the .env file, `load_dotenv()` will update the `os.environ` dictionary with the key-value pairs from the .env file.

* It is important to call `load_dotenv()` before accessing the `SECRET_KEY` in your `settings.py` file.

## Accessing the `SECRET_KEY` in your `settings.py` file

Now that you have loaded the `SECRET_KEY` from the `.env` file, you can access it in your `settings.py` file using the `os` module:

```python
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
```

By using `os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')`, you can access the `SECRET_KEY` value stored in the `.env` file. This ensures that the `SECRET_KEY` is not hard-coded in your codebase and is kept secure.

Please note the above steps can be applied to other sensitive information in your Django project.
